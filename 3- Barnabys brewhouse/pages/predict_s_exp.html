<h1>Why, %short_qcode</h1>
<p>
A specific week's prediction is generated by first finding all relevant weeks within the past data (relevant weeks are those within 2 weeks of the selected one belonging to any year).  Once relevant weeks have been found the quarterly growth rate (that is the increase in sales every quarter) is found.  This growth rate is then multiplied by a configurable constant [currently: <b>%growth_importance</b>] to give a final growth rate.  All the relevant weeks are then adjusted to current time via use of the growth rate and then the average is found to even out the effects of one large sale in the past.
