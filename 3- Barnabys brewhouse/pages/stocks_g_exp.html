<h1>Why, General-Stocks</h1>
<p>
The expected stock is a combination of 3 factors:<ul>
<li>The current stocks of each beer</li>
<li>The expected gains for each beer from tanks finishing brewing and being bottled</li>
<li>The predicted demand (<a href="/why?predict=general">Click here to see explanation</a>)</li>
</ul>
From these factors the expected stock is generated. Note: The <i>tanks finishing brewing</i> prediction only includes tanks in the future, so if a tank's end date was in the past, then it will not be counted potentially making the situation seem worse than it is.  This also has the effect of making the tanks carrying that beer more important, often raising the priority of them (helping ensure beers that are low are replenished sooner).
